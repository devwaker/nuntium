# Mobiles Numbers table #

The Mobile Numbers tables stores country and carrier information of a message. This information can be specified via [custom attributes](Messages#Custom_attributes.md).

Storing this allows an overall better routing since some channels can only send messages that provide from a particular country/carrier (see [channel restrictions](Channel#Restrictions.md)).
